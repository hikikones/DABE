	abstract =	{Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in which excess buffers in the network cause high latency and latency variation. As more and more interactive applications (e.g., voice over IP, real-time video streaming, and financial transactions) run in the Internet, high latency and latency variation degrade application performance. There is a pressing need to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and latency variation, and hence provide desirable quality of service to users. This document presents a lightweight active queue management design called "PIE" (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queuing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical analysis, and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link utilization under various congestion situations. The design does not require per-packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and is simple enough to implement in both hardware and software.},

	abstract =	{This document specifies the BBR congestion control algorithm. BBR uses recent measurements of a transport connection's delivery rate and round-trip time to build an explicit model that includes both the maximum recent bandwidth available to that connection, and its minimum recent round-trip delay. BBR then uses this model to control both how fast it sends data and the maximum amount of data it allows in flight in the network at any time. Relative to loss-based congestion control algorithms such as Reno {[}RFC5681{]} or CUBIC {[}draft-ietf-tcpm-cubic{]}, BBR offers substantially higher throughput for bottlenecks with shallow buffers or random losses, and substantially lower queueing delays for bottlenecks with deep buffers (avoiding "bufferbloat"). This algorithm can be implemented in any transport protocol that supports packet-delivery acknowledgment (thus far, open source implementations are available for TCP {[}RFC793{]} and QUIC {[}draft-ietf-quic-transport-00{]}).},
